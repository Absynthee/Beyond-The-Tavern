                <h2>Beyond The Blog</h2>
                <p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty,
            dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy
            smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to
            sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means
            comfort.
            It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted
            green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.
            The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a
            very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled
            walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with
            polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and
            coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound
            on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side
            of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles
            round called it—and many little round doors opened out
            of it, first on one side and then on another. No going
            upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars,
            pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms
            devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on
            the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best
            rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these
            were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round
            windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond,
            sloping down to the river.
            This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name
            was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the
            neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and
            people considered them very respectable, not only
            because most of them were rich, but also because they
            never had any adventures or did anything unexpected:
            you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question
            without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a
            Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and
            saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the
            neighbours’ respect, but he gained—well, you will see
            whether he gained anything in the end.</p><p>
                The mother of our particular hobbit—what is a hobbit?
            I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since
            they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they
            call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our
            height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits
            have no beards. There is little or no magic about them,
            except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to
            disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like
            you and me come blundering along, making a noise like
            elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are
            inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright
            colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes,
            because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick
            warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is
            curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured
            faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after
            dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).
            Now you know enough to go on with.</p><p>
                As I was saying,
            the mother of this hobbit—of Bilbo Baggins, that is—was
            the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable
            daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived
            across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of
            The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long
            ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy
            wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was
            still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and
            once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and
            have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the
            family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks
            were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they
            were undoubtedly richer.</p><p>
                Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures
            after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was
            Bilbo’s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for
            her (and partly with her money) that was to be found
            either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The
            Water, and there they remained to the end of their days.
            Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he
            looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his
            solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in
            his make-up from the Took side, something that only
            waited for a chance to come out. The chance never
            arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about
            fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbithole built by his father, which I have just described for
            you, until he had in fact apparently settled down
            immovably.
            By some curious chance one morning long ago in the
            quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more
            green, and the hobbits were still numerous and
            prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door
            after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe
            that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly
            brushed)—Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard
            only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have
            only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be
            prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and
            adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he
            went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been
            down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since
            his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had
            almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away
            over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his
            own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbitgirls.
            All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was
            an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a
            long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white
            beard hung down below his waist, and immense black
            boots.</p>

                <h2>Roast Mutton</h2>
                <p>Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went
            into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but all the
            signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful
            mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the
            kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to
            have been used. The washing-up was so dismally real that
            Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before
            had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather
            hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think that
            they had all gone without him, and without bothering to
            wake him up (“but with never a thank-you” he thought);
            and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle
            disappointed. The feeling surprised him.</p><p>
                “Don’t be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!” he said to himself,
            “thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at
            your age!” So he put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water,
            and washed up. Then he had a nice little breakfast in the
            kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time
            the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting
            in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly
            and to forget about the night before. In fact he was just
            sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the diningroom by the open window, when in walked Gandalf.
            “My dear fellow,” said he, “whenever are you going to
            come? What about an early start?—and here you are
            having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half past ten!
            They left you the message, because they could not wait.”
            “What message?” said poor Mr. Baggins all in a
            fluster.
            “Great Elephants!” said Gandalf, “you are not at all
            yourself this morning—you have never dusted the
            mantelpiece!”
            “What’s that got to do with it? I have had enough to do
            with washing up for fourteen!”
            “If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have
            found this just under the clock,” said Gandalf, handing
            Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his own note-paper).</p><p>
                They had not been riding very long, when up came
            Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. He had brought a
            lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo’s pipe and
            tobacco. So after that the party went along very merrily,
            and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward
            all day, except of course when they stopped for meals.
            These didn’t come quite as often as Bilbo would have
            liked them, but still he began to feel that adventures were
            not so bad after all.
            At first they had passed through hobbit-lands, a wide
            respectable country inhabited by decent folk, with good
            roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf or a
            farmer ambling by on business. Then they came to lands
            where people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo had
            never heard before. Now they had gone on far into the
            Lone-lands, where there were no people left, no inns, and
            the roads grew steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary
            hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some
            of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had
            been built by wicked people. Everything seemed gloomy,
            for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it
            had been as good as May can be, can be, even in merry
            tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-lands they
            had been obliged to camp when they could, but at least it
            had been dry.</p><p>
                “To think it will soon be June!” grumbled Bilbo, as he
            splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track. It
            was after tea-time; it was pouring with rain, and had been
            all day; his hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was
            full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones;
            the others were too grumpy to talk. “And I’m sure the
            rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags,”
            thought Bilbo. “Bother burgling and everything to do
            with it! I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire,
            with the kettle just beginning to sing!” It was not the last
            time that he wished that!
            Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or
            taking any notice of the hobbit. Somewhere behind the
            grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for it began to
            get dark as they went down into a deep valley with a river
            at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along its banks
            bent and sighed. Fortunately the road went over an
            ancient stone bridge, for the river, swollen with the rains,
            came rushing down from the hills and mountains in the
            north.</p>

                <h2>Over Hill and Under Hill</h2>
                <p>There were many paths that led up into those mountains,
            and many passes over them. But most of the paths were
            cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends;
            and most of the passes were infested by evil things and
            dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by
            the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory
            of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.
            Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and
            left the Last Homely House miles behind, they were still
            going up and up and up. It was a hard path and a
            dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long.
            Now they could look back over the lands they had left,
            laid out behind them far below. Far, far away in the West,
            where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay
            his own country of safe and comfortable things, and his
            little hobbit-hole. He shivered. It was getting bitter cold
            up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks.
            Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the
            mountain-sides, let loose by mid-day sun upon the snow,
            and passed among them (which was lucky), or over their
            heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless
            and chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk too loud,
            for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed to
            dislike being broken—except by the noise of water and
            the wail of wind and the crack of stone.</p><p>
                “The summer is getting on down below,” thought
            Bilbo, “and haymaking is going on and picnics. They will
            be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to
            go down the other side at this rate.” And the others were
            thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they
            had said good-bye to Elrond in the high hope of a
            midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the
            passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the
            lands beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret
            door in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last
            moon of Autumn—“and perhaps it will be Durin’s Day”
            they had said. Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said
            nothing. Dwarves had not passed that way for many
            years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger
            had grown and thriven in the Wild, since the dragons had
            driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in
            secret after the battle of the Mines of Moria. Even the
            good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good
            friends like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off
            on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild; and
            Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it.</p><p>
                He knew that something unexpected might happen, and
            he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without
            fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with
            lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled. They did
            not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm
            —more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle. You know
            how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the
            land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two
            great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are
            thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when
            storms come up from East and West and make war. The
            lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and
            great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into
            every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with
            overwhelming noise and sudden light.
            Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind.
            They were high up in a narrow place, with a dreadful fall
            into a dim valley at one side of them. There they were
            sheltering under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay
            beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe. When he
            peeped out in the lightning-flashes, he saw that across the
            valley the stone-giants were out, and were hurling rocks
            at one another for a game, and catching them, and tossing
            them down into the darkness where they smashed among
            the trees far below, or splintered into little bits with a
            bang. Then came a wind and a rain, and the wind
            whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction, so
            that an overhanging rock was no protection at all. Soon
            they were getting drenched and their ponies were
            standing with their heads down and their tails between
            their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright.
            They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all
            over the mountainsides.</p><p>
                “This won’t do at all!” said Thorin. “If we don’t get
            blown off, or drowned, or struck by lightning, we shall be
            picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a
            football.”</p>

                <h2>Riddles in the Dark</h2>
                <p>When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for
            it was just as dark as with them shut. No one was
            anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could hear
            nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the
            stone of the floor.
            Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours,
            till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but neither up nor
            down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of
            goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and
            he was far from certain even of the direction they had
            been going in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as
            he could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly
            his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying
            on the floor of the tunnel. It was a turning point in his
            career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his
            pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem
            of any particular use at the moment. He did not go much
            further, but sat down on the cold floor and gave himself
            up to complete miserableness, for a long while. He
            thought of himself frying bacon and eggs in his own
            kitchen at home—for he could feel inside that it was high
            time for some meal or other; but that only made him
            miserabler.</p><p>
                He could not think what to do; nor could he think what
            had happened; or why he had been left behind; or why, if
            he had been left behind, the goblins had not caught him;
            or even why his head was so sore. The truth was he had
            been lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very
            dark corner for a long while.
            After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken,
            and that was something. Then he felt for his pouch, and
            there was some tobacco in it, and that was something
            more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any
            at all, and that shattered his hopes completely. Just as
            well for him, as he agreed when he came to his senses.
            Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the
            smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark
            holes in that horrible place. Still at the moment he felt
            very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets and feeling
            all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of
            his little sword—the little dagger that he got from the
            trolls, and that he had quite forgotten; nor fortunately had
            the goblins noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches.
            Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim before his
            eyes. “So it is an elvish blade, too,” he thought; “and
            goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough.”
            But somehow he was comforted. It was rather splendid
            to be wearing a blade made in Gondolin for the goblinwars of which so many songs had sung; and also he had
            noticed that such weapons made a great impression on
            goblins that came upon them suddenly.
            “Go back?” he thought. “No good at all! Go sideways?
            Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do! On we go!”
            So up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held
            in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his
            heart all of a patter and a pitter.
            Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place.
            But you must remember it was not quite so tight for him
            as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits are not
            quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are
            nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from
            the tunnels of the goblins, still they are more used to
            tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their
            sense of direction underground—not when their heads
            have recovered from being bumped. Also they can move
            very quietly, and hide easily, and recover wonderfully
            from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom
            and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or
            have forgotten long ago.</p><p>
                I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins’
            place, all the same. The tunnel seemed to have no end.
            All he knew was that it was still going down pretty
            steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a
            twist and a turn or two. There were passages leading off
            to the side every now and then, as he knew by the
            glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the
            wall. Of these he took no notice, except to hurry past for
            fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming out
            of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and
            still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional
            whirr of a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it
            became too frequent to bother about. I do not know how
            long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to
            stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. It seemed like
            all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.
            Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into
            water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That pulled him up sharp and
            short. He did not know whether it was just a pool in the
            path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed
            the passage, or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake.
            The sword was hardly shining at all. He stopped, and he
            could hear, when he listened hard, drops drip-dripdripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but
            there seemed no other sort of sound</p>

                <h2>The Gathering of the Clouds</h2>
                <p>As you have heard some of the events already, you will
            see that the dwarves still had some days before them.
            They explored the caverns once more, and found, as they
            expected, that only the Front Gate remained open; all the
            other gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had
            long ago been broken and blocked by Smaug, and no sign
            of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in
            fortifying the main entrance, and in making a new path
            that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the
            miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at
            such work the dwarves were still very skilled.
            As they worked the ravens brought them constant
            tidings. In this way they learned that the Elvenking had
            turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a breathing
            space. Better still, they heard that three of their ponies
            had escaped and were wandering wild far down the banks
            of the Running River, not far from where the rest of their
            stores had been left. So while the others went on with
            their work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to
            find the ponies and bring back all they could.
            </p><p>
                They were four days gone, and by that time they knew
            that the joined armies of the Lake-men and the Elves
            were hurrying toward the Mountain. But now their hopes
            were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care
            —chiefly cram, of course, and they were very tired of it;
            but cram is much better than nothing—and already the
            gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry,
            but very thick and high, across the opening. There were
            holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot),
            but no entrance. They climbed in or out with ladders, and
            hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream
            they had contrived a small low arch under the new wall;
            but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow bed
            that a wide pool stretched from the mountain-wall to the
            head of the fall over which the stream went towards Dale.
            Approach to the Gate was now only possible, without
            swimming, along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right
            as one looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they
            had brought only to the head of the steps above the old
            bridge, and unloading them there had bidden them return
            to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South.</p><p>
                There came a night when suddenly there were many
            lights as of fires and torches away south in Dale before
            them.
            “They have come!” called Balin. “And their camp is
            very great. They must have come into the valley under the
            cover of dusk along both banks of the river.”
            That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was
            still pale when they saw a company approaching. From
            behind their wall they watched them come up to the
            valley’s head and climb slowly up. Before long they
            could see that both men of the lake armed as if for war
            and elvish bowmen were among them. At length the
            foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and
            appeared at the top of the falls; and very great was their
            surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked
            with a wall of new-hewn stone.
            As they stood pointing and speaking to one another
            Thorin hailed them: “Who are you,” he called in a very
            loud voice, “that come as if in war to the gates of Thorin
            son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you
            desire?”
            But they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back,
            and the others after gazing for a while at the Gate and its
            defences soon followed them. That day the camp was
            moved to the east of the river, right between the arms of
            the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and
            with song, as they had not done for many a day. There
            was the sound, too, of elven-harps and of sweet music;
            and as it echoed up towards them it seemed that the chill
            of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the
            fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring.
            Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and
            to go down and join in the mirth and feasting by the fires.
            Some of the younger dwarves were moved in their hearts,
            too, and they muttered that they wished things had fallen
            out otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as
            friends; but Thorin scowled.
            Then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and
            instruments regained from the hoard, and made music to
            soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish song,
            and was much like the song they had sung long before in
            Bilbo’s little hobbit-hole.
